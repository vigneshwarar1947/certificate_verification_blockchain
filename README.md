🎓 Certificate Verification using Blockchain

This project is a simple yet powerful blockchain-based certificate verification system.

✅ Institute Role: Only authorized institutes can publish (store) certificate hash values to the blockchain using a secure login with username and password.
🔍 Verifier Role: Anyone can upload a certificate and verify whether it's valid by checking against blockchain records.

⚠️ Note:
While anyone can verify a certificate, only approved institutions are allowed to issue (publish) them. This ensures the integrity and trust of the system.

🧠 Tip: Don’t just use this tool blindly—take time to understand how it works! Learning the technology behind it (blockchain, hashing, Web3) will help you grow as a developer and innovator.

🎯 All the best, and happy learning!
